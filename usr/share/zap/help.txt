ZAP
===

The zap utility is the primary administration tool for software on
Tribblix.

By default, whenever operations such as install,update or refresh of overlay/packages and download of images during
setup of zones are executed,zap fetches the needed files over the internet in silent mode,without showing progress of the 
download. However the progress of the download process can be shown by enabling the following configuration option to
/etc/zap/zap_config.conf:

show_download_progress=yes 

The basic usage is:

zap subcommand [arguments ...]

The subcommands are:

refresh

  This subcommand refreshes the list of overlays, their contents, and
  the package catalog.

search [-R dir] search_term

  This subcommand searches for overlays and packages matching the given
  search term.

retrieve pkg [pkg ...]

  This subcomand will retrieve the package(s) specified from a
  repository and save it or them to the local cache

install [-R dir] [-s dir] pkg [pkg ...]

  This subcommand will install the package or packages specified. The
  -R flag allows you to specify an alternate root for installation, the
  -s flag allows you to specify a local directory containing packages
  (for example, the CD).

update [-R dir] pkg [pkg ...]

  This subcommand will update the given package(s) to the latest
  available version.

uninstall [-R dir] pkg [pkg ...]

  This subcommand will uninstall the given package(s).

list-packages [args]

  Simply lists the installed packages; this is an alias for the
  pkginfo utility.

check-package pkg [pkg ...]

  Checks that the contents of an installed package are correct. This
  is essentially a wrapper round the pkgchk utility.

list-overlays [-R dir] [-i|-u] [-v]

  This subcommand lists the available overlays. With -i, just shows
  installed overlays. With -u, just shows uninstalled overlays.
  Without -i or -u, indicates whether the overlay is installed.
  With -v, also shows the short description of the overlay

install-overlay [-R dir] [-s dir] overlay

  This subcommand will install the given overlay, and any overlays it
  depends upon.

update-overlay [-R dir] [-s dir] overlay | -a

  This subcommand will update all the packages in the given overlay to
  the current version. If -a, updates all installed overlays.

uninstall-overlay [-R dir] overlay

  This subcommnd will uninstall the given overlay, and all the
  packages it contains that are not required by other overlays. If the
  overlay is required by another overlay, it is not uninstalled.

verify-overlay [-R dir] overlay | -a

  This subcommand checks that all the packages contained in the given
  installed overlay are in fact installed and are at the current
  version. If -a, verifies all installed overlays.

clean-cache -a | -i | -o | -u

  This subcommand will clean up the cached downloaded zap files. With
  -a, clean the entire cache. With -i, clean zap files corresponding
  to installed packages. With -o, clean up old zap files. With -u,
  clean up zap files for unrecognised packages.

set-hostname hostname | -d domainname

  This subcommand updates the current hostname (and the /etc/nodename
  file) or, with -d, the current domainname.

create-zone [args]

  This subcommand simplifies the creation of non-global zones. Run
  'zap help create-zone' for more details.

destroy-zone -z zone_name

  This subcommand destroys the given zone.

create-zone-template [args]

  This subcommand allows the construction of an alternate file-system
  that can be used to provide the basis for an alternative sparse-root
  zone. Run 'zap help create-zone-template' for more details.

list-zone-templates

  This subcommand list the known zone templates, their file system
  roots, and zones using the template.

destroy-zone-template [-n] -T template_name

  This subcommand destroys a zone template and the file system backing
  it. The action will fail if any zones are using the template.

add-locale name [name...]

  This subcommand allows you to add locales. Run 'zap help add-locale'
  for details.

remove-locale name [name...]

  This subcommand allows you to remove locales. Run 'zap help add-locale'
